# Dropout value during training
# Those values define the probability to keep a cell active during training
# Recommanded values are 0.8 for input (dropping 20%) and 0.5 for output (dropping 50%)

# Number of mini-batch inside a batch (gradient update will happen only between batchs)

# Signal processing mode, options are mfcc or fbank
#  - mfcc is Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (20-dim input)
#  - fbank is mel filterbank (including delta and double-delta, 120-dim input)
# mfcc is essentially fbank with an extra DCT (discrete cosine transformation) applied
# delta and double-delta represent 'velocity' and 'acceleration' of the input signal
# Recommanded value is fbank which give better training result

# The ratio to which the internal state of the RNN will be reset to 0. For example :
#   1.0 mean the RNN internal state will be reset at the end of each batch
#   0.25 mean there is 25% chances that the RNN internal state will be reset at the end of each batch

#  - Those two values need to be consistent one with the other
#  - These values depends on your dataset used for training
