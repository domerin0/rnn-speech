# Dropout value during training
# Define the probability to keep a cell active during training
# The value is set for the last layer, each previous layer will have 0.2 added with a max to 1.0
# So for exemple a 5 layers model with dropout value of 0.5 will have
# layer 1 : dropout = 1.0 ==> no dropout
# layer 2 : dropout = 1.0 ==> no dropout
# layer 3 : dropout = 0.9 ==> 10% dropout
# layer 4 : dropout = 0.7 ==> 30% dropout
# layer 5 : dropout = 0.5 ==> 50% dropout

# Signal processing mode, options are mfcc or fbank
#  - mfcc is Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (20-dim input)
#  - fbank is mel filterbank (including delta and double-delta, 120-dim input)
# mfcc is essentially fbank with an extra DCT (discrete cosine transformation) applied
# delta and double-delta represent 'velocity' and 'acceleration' of the input signal
# Recommanded value is fbank which give better training result

# The ratio to which the internal state of the RNN will be reset to 0. For example :

#  - Those two values need to be consistent one with the other
